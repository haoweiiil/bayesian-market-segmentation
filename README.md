# Market Segmentation with Multivariate-Gaussian Mixture Model

## Introduction

In making marketing-related decisions, we often want to identify different types of customers based on demographic characteristics and their past behaviors. In subscription business model, we may want to conduct campaigns that target customers who are mostly likely to convert. In other instances, we may need to differentiate the more loyal customers from the others, and offer specialized discount programs. The first step towards any actions would be identifying customers segments: in this analysis, I use a concise mall customer data to demonstrate how to group customers together based on their spending behaviors using Multivariate-Gaussian Mixture model. I believe this analysis paradigm can be easily extended to more complex situations where we may have more information about the consumers, or that there are more types of consumers. 

## Data

The data I will be using is the **[Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)** from Kaggle.
